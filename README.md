# Tree-Search-Algorithms

This project implements four tree search algorithms, Breadth-first search (BFS), Depth-first search (DFS), Kruskal's algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm. A Makefile is provided to compile the project and run tests. The algorithm can be used for integers, strings and student ids. A folder of tests is also provided.
